This repository is based on the repository and article by Maxine Meurer on dev.to [How to Create a 3D Cube in ReactJS](https://dev.to/mmeurer00/how-to-create-a-3d-cube-in-reactjs-1ej7). 

I have added features including random draw of from image arrays, choosing which image does not belong, and background changes according to correct/incorrect choice by user.
